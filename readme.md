# CeRaMic

**CeRaMic** is a project I developed in my spare time applying everything I learnt in my experince as software engineer to a real business problem. **CeRaMic** is a cloud-ready, mobile-first client relationship management webapp. On the Front-End an AngularJS application consumes REST APIs and receives notifications via SignalR. On the Back-End the business domain is shaped using DDD, EventSourcing and CQRS on MSSQL databbse.
